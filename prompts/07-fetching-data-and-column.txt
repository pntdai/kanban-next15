You did really good. Now we will continue in server side.
- Based on the built of UI on @KanbanBoard.tsx and @TaskCard.tsx. Wee need to fetch columns and tasks.
- This shhould achieved through:
- It's Next.js so use Server Components when possible.
- Use server actions when possible.
- For now only handle the column & task fetching, storing/updating/deleting - this should ignored for now, and make sure not to use useEffect.
